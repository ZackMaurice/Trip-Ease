		\item{Packing Checklist}
		For our checklist we implemented everything we had originally set out to do.
		The checklist allows users to add items to the list. Users can remove items by swiping left on them.
		Users can keep tracks of which items they have packed with a checkbox associated with each item. Users are given a set of common items for different types of trips.
		They can load from these templates, add their own custom templates and/or delete any templates they don't wish to keep.

		\item{Itinerary/Planner}

		\item{Budgeting}

		\item{Misc Utilities}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Weather
			\item Local emergency numbers
			\item Translation \& Common Phrases
		\end{itemize}

		\item{Offline Saving}

	\end{itemize}

	\section*{Non-Functional Properties}


	\begin{enumerate}
		\item{User-friendly and accessible user interface}
		Our user interface is a very simple layout that users will be immediately familiar with it. Navigation between features is done through a bottom navigation bar.
		Obvious functionality (adding items/templates) is done through labelled buttons. Removing items is done through swiping left.
		A user jumping into our application will have very if (if any) questions about how to use our application.
		We feel that we accomplished implementing all the functionality that we wanted, while maintaining a simple and familiar user interface.

		\item{Store user templates locally on the mobile device}

		\item{Quick and efficient retrieval of data}
