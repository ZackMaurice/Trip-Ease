	The intent of TripEase is, above all else, to provide a simple way to keep track of the inanities of vacationing.
	As a team, we broke this problem down into what we thought to be the three most important,
	yet tedious aspects of planning and executing a successful vacation:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Packing a suitcase
		\item Organizing your time
		\item Managing spending
	\end{itemize}
	Our app's overall architecture was based around these three tasks.
	One of the main themes we chose as a pillar was simpicity and easy of use.
	Keeping the app divided into four tabs (one additional tab for settings and other corner cases) accomplished this.

	The second pillar we chose was on- and offline capability for all primary features.
	Firebase was our chosen storage medium, and it has allowed seamless cloud integration from day one.

	The MVC architecture was a perfect choice for this application, as it mainly displays information statically,
	and allows the user to interactively update.
	Without any external systems other than the firebase cloudstore, the app only needs allow the user to interact,
	then update the server when needed.

	Over-all, the goal of TripEase is to remove the stress of mundane vacationing tasks,
	allowing users to fully take advantage of the time they have to themselves;
	or, in the case of working travellers, limit any external sourced of stress and uncertainty
	so that they may be as productive as possible.

	With this goal in mind, making TripEase as intuitive and user friendly as possible,
	without any extraneous features that could distract from its mission statement is crucial.
	Limiting the functionality to these core features,
	instead of providing a cluttered, "feature rich experience" accomplishes this.
