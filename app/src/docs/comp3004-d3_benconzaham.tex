		The intent of TripEase is, above all else, to provide a simple way to keep track of the inanities of vacationing.
		As a team, we broke this problem down into what we thought to be the three most important,
		yet tedious aspects of planning and executing a successful vacation:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Packing a suitcase
			\item Organizing your time
			\item Managing spending
		\end{itemize}
		Our app's overall architecture was based around these three tasks.
		One of the main themes we chose as a pillar was simpicity and easy of use.
		Keeping the app divided into four tabs (one additional tab for settings and other corner cases) accomplished this.

		The second pillar we chose was on- and offline capability for all primary features.
		Firebase was our chosen storage medium, and it has allowed seamless cloud integration from day one.

		The MVC architecture was a perfect choice for this application, as it mainly displays information statically,
		and allows the user to interactively update.
		Without any external systems other than the firebase cloudstore, the app only needs to interact with the user,
		then update the server when needed.
